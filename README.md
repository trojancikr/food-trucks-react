Food Trucks
===========

Generated via `create-react-app` and contains pretty much untouched `react-scripts`. Start with `yarn start`.

The application is purposely "under-engineered" - keeping the components and the supporting application code in the same `src` folder. Data transformation logic is concentrated within `data.js` (really not good name, but oh well) but at least it is being reusable and keeping the component code a little bit more civil (and hopefully more readable too). Styling is very basic (pretty much "mobile first") with the map integration added in last moment.
